# Langauge Learning Tool - Uni Coursework
## About 
Created a multi-level multi-language quiz for a JavaScript peice of coursework. Uses plain JS to achieve a relatively simple goal, although some parts could be improved.
## Possible improvements
- Make the data output more dynamic, could be more efficient in the use of if statement etc.
- Larger variance in the questions and formats etc.
- Ensure all code is placed inside of the JavaScript files, and not inside of the elements.

note: images have been removed from this Github version and should be placed in the `img` and `img/work` folders.
